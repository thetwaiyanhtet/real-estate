        content: "An online mortgage calculator can help you quickly and accurately predict your monthly mortgage payment with just a few pieces of information. It can also show you the total amount of interest you’ll pay over the life of your mortgage. To use this calculator, you’ll need the following information Home price: This is the dollar amount you expect to pay for a home. Down payment: This is the portion of the home’s price you’re not financing with a mortgage. For many borrowers, this is as little as 3 percent. Loan term: This is the length of the mortgage repayment term, such as 30 years or 15 years. Interest rate: This is the interest rate you’ll pay for a new mortgage, whether you’re buying a home or refinancing your current loan."
